 * Encapsulation is a way of protecting the data in a class from being
 * unintentionally altered from another class.
 * 
 * To encapsulate a member variable, follow these three steps:
 * 
 * 1. Make the member variable private (or protected)
 * 
 * 2. Make a getter and setter method (accessor and mutator) for the variable.
 * 
 * 3. Add restrictions to the setter method so the member variable cannot be 
 * 	  adversely altered
